Assignment:

For this last assignment, I would like you to integrate all the elements we have seen during this class, along with your previous analysis, to produce a final, comprehensive analysis of this dataset.

You need to showcase all the methods we have seen, in meaningful examples along with explanations. You will all be asked to present your work in class on Friday. You will have 10 minutes for the presentation and for questions.

Prepare a clean notebook and be ready to present.
